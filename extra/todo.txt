difficulty settings maybe? 
	difficulty changes these things:
		enemy spawn rate
		enemy speed
		enemy health
		points given by enemies
		coin speed

different modes maybe?
	mode where it's just shooty enemies
	mode where it's just bosses
	mode where you have 1hp
	mode where coins hurt you

pause screen
	pauses game and overlays what's on the menu screen
	volume sliders
	quit game
	quit to menu
	hotkeys

shop
	upgrades:
		spiky ball: increase pendulum damage
		extra pendulum point
		max hp increase
		make flail bigger?

sfx
	convert current sfx to .ogg

bosses
	boss with flail
	boss with hands that fly at you like the bosses in every nintendo game

death anim/cutscene/thing for player so it doesn't just snap to death screen suddenly

If we want to do more, we could just add more bosses/enemies/upgrades if we think of any ideas.
